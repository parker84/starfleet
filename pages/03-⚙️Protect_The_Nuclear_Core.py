    """### Your Mission 🛸
You need to monitor the nuclear core of the ship and all of its components to make sure it doesn't malfunction.

You'll need to build 🛠️:
- Outlier Detection Models
- Monitoring Dashboard
- Survival Analysis Model

If you fail, the nuclear core will cause a nuclear reaction and the explosion will kill you and your entire crew.

Edit the **`Execution Code`** 🔧 below to build a robot that will protect the ship.
