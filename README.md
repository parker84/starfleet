## Game Introduction
Congrats on your new role as the Chief Data Science Officer on the USS Enterprise (the best starship in the United Federation of Planets fleet - [watch this video for more context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLNupChQc2k)).

You and your team are about to embark on a journey to explore the final frontier - space.

You specifically will be tasked with leveraging data science to make a meaningful impact on this journey, do the job well and youâ€™ll play a crucial role in:

- Discovering unknown civilizations in deep space
- Defending those in need
- Ensuring the safety and well being of your crew

Do the job poorly and you and your entire crew will die.
